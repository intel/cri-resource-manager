## ⚠️ The project is no longer maintained ⚠️

The CRI Resource manager project is no longer maintained. No further updates,
bug fixes or releases are planned.

We recommend users migrate to
[NRI Plugins](https://github.com/containers/nri-plugins), which provides
similar functionality and is actively maintained.

Thank you for being part of this journey!
